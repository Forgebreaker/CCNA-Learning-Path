I. What's a Network?

    Like people or groups communicating (dictionary definition).
    In IT: Computers connected (usually by cable) to communicate and transfer data.

II. Local Area Network (LAN):

    Connects devices in small, close areas (workplaces, homes, offices, schools, campuses).
    Lets computers, printers, and network devices talk to each other.
    Example: Three computers connected via switches exchanging data.

III. Wide Area Network (WAN):

    Private networks covering large areas (cities, countries).
    Connects multiple LANs together.
    The largest WAN is the internet.
    Uses routers to connect LANs (don't worry, you'll learn routers later too).
    Differences from LANs will be covered in more detail later.

IV. LAN vs WAN Differences (Highlighted Now):

    Location: LANs = Homes, schools, offices. WANs = Cities, countries, worldwide.
    Technology: LANs use Ethernet/Wi-Fi.
    Speed: LANs have higher transfer rates than WANs.
    Cost: LANs are less costly and have lower maintenance than WANs.
    Devices: LANs use switches/hubs. WANs need routers/gateways.
    Troubleshooting: Problems are easier to understand in LANs than in WANs.

V. Campus Area Network (CAN):

    Spans an educational or corporate campus (e.g., university campus, company buildings).
    Larger than a LAN, covering multiple buildings in an area.
    Usually made up of several LANs.
    Works like LANs: Users with wired/wireless access can talk directly to other systems on the network.

VI. Storage Area Network (SAN):

    Developed because increased internet usage/data sharing made old storage solutions inadequate (personally and for companies).
    We produce/share more data every year, so storage is a lasting need.
    SAN = A fast, secure network connecting servers and storage units.
    Problem Solved: In a standard LAN, all users (including file servers) share the same network. This general traffic slows things down.
    SAN Solution: Moving storage connections to a separate network avoids daily user traffic, giving much higher performance.
