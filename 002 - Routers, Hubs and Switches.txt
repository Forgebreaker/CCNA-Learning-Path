I. Router Explained

    Analogy: A router is compared to highways and road signs.
    Function: Just like road signs direct car traffic, routers direct data traffic, telling it where to go.
    Difference in Analogy: Road signs don't care who passes under them, but routers actually control the data, deciding if it can pass or not.
    Picture Description: Routers connect two or more computers and provide smooth, controlled data transfer between them at high speed.
    Links your local network (LAN) to the wider internet (WAN).

II. Hub Explained

    General Function: Hubs connect computers on a Local Area Network (LAN). They have multiple ports.
    How it Works: When data (a packet) arrives at one port, the hub copies it to all other ports. 
                  This means every computer on the network sees every piece of data.
    Device Interaction: The computer that was supposed to get the data confirms it and accepts it. Other computers ignore it.
    Problem: Sending data to everyone creates high "traffic density" or "rush hour," leading to low performance. 
             It's like a busy highway during rush hour.
    Bandwidth Sharing: The hub splits the total network bandwidth evenly among all connected devices. 
                       For example, 100Mbps shared by 5 devices gives each device 20Mbps.
    Usage Limitation: Because of this sharing and low performance, hubs aren't used in large networks needing high bandwidth.
    Types:
        + Active Hub: Amplifies the incoming signal before sending it out (used to overcome signal loss over long cables).
        + Passive Hub: Simply passes the incoming signal to other ports without changing it.

III. Switch Explained

    General Function: Switches also connect computers (nodes) in workplaces or homes, enabling communication and file/data transfer between them. 
                      This saves time compared to manual methods like USB drives ("run it down the hallway").
    Benefit: They make connecting multiple computers and devices like printers much easier.
    How it Works (Key Feature): Unlike hubs, a switch provides the full bandwidth of the network to each port individually.
    Bandwidth Example: If the switch operates at 75Mbps, every device connected to a switch port gets its own full 75Mbps connection ("No loss").
    Result: This dedicated bandwidth means all connected devices operate at the same high speed, making transactions very fast
    Setup: Devices plug into the switch's ports, and configuration is done on the computers themselves.

IV. Summary

    Hub: Dumb broadcaster. Shouts everything to everyone on the local network. Slow, causes traffic jams. 
    Switch: Smart director. Whispers directly only to the intended recipient on the local network. Fast, efficient.
    Router: Network navigator & gatekeeper. Connects your local network (where your switch/hub/computers are) to the internet. 
            Controls what comes in/out. Points data to the right network (like the internet or another local network).
