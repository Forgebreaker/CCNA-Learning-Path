[!] Wi-Fi is Everywhere 

    As technology and the internet develop, wireless technology (which you see everywhere) has become a huge part of daily life. 
    The internet brings many innovations, and "wireless" is often called Wi-Fi.

    - How Wi-Fi Works (Basics): Wi-Fi works using radio waves. These radio waves are old technology. 
                                They are produced based on specific standards and detected by receivers built into devices.

    - Devices Use Wi-Fi: Many everyday devices (like phones and computers) have wireless connections, meaning they can pick up these radio waves. 
                         The instructor checks if you understand ("Right? Are you with me? Cool.").

    - Connecting to Network: These radio waves are how you connect to your local area network (LAN).

    - Adding Wi-Fi to Computers: If your computer doesn't have built-in wireless, you can plug in a little wireless adapter.

    - Wi-Fi System Parts: Parts of a wireless system include DSL modems, wireless network adapters, access points, and wireless bridges.

    - Where Wi-Fi is Used: Wi-Fi is used in many areas, especially in mobile phones and computers, which are central to modern life.

    - Two Types of Wireless Networks: Wireless connections are divided into two main types:

            WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network): This is just the wireless concept. It's an abbreviation for "wireless local area network." 
                                                It lets devices exchange information using radio waves in a wireless area (like cell phones do).

            WAN (Wide Area Network): This is an abbreviation for "wide area network." 
                                     It's a system used in tough conditions or where cables aren't practical, creating a wireless wide area network.

    - Coverage & Signal Strength: Wireless routers and access points need to be installed so the signal can be received well. 
                                  You might see people moving their phone strangely to get a better signal â€“ this is about the coverage cell. 
                                  If one access point isn't enough for the area, you can add more. 
                                  You can also add an access point to your home router to improve coverage.

    - How Communication Works (Detailed): Wireless networks talk using radio signals, similar to old cordless phones, TVs, or car radios. 
                                          It's two-way radio communication:
                                            " Your computer's wireless adapter turns data into radio signals and sends them out via an antenna.
                                              The wireless router gets the signal and decodes it.
                                              The router then sends the information to the internet using a physical cable."

    - This also works in reverse: The router gets info from the internet, turns it into radio signals, and sends them back to your computer's wireless adapter.
