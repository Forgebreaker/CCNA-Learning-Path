I. What Servers Do & Their Features

 - Purpose:
    + Run software/programs for multiple users to share data.
    + Enable 24/7 internet access (thanks to data centers with security, generators, and cooling).

 - Power & Design:
    + More powerful than personal computers.
    + Built to work non-stop (uninterrupted).
    + Handle multiple tasks faster (more memory, network connections, hard drives, and CPUs).

 - Web Servers (Most Common Type):
    + Store website content (text/images/videos).
    + Publish sites by serving content to internet users.

II. How Servers Work: IPs, DNS & Content Delivery

 - IP Addresses:
    Every server/website has a unique IP address (e.g., 255.21.122.123).
    IP = 4 numbers between 0–255.

 - DNS (Domain Name System):
    Translates website names (like "google.com") into IP addresses.
    When you type a site name, DNS converts it to the IP so your browser can find the server.

 - Content Delivery Process:
    User clicks a link → request goes to server → server sends content (text/images/videos) to the user’s computer → browser displays it.

III. Server Software

 - Special software like Nginx or Apache:
    + Installed on servers to analyze user requests.
    + Display the right content in the visitor’s browser.
