I. What is TCP/IP?
    - Definition:
        A communication method combining TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) + IP (Internet Protocol).
        Purpose: Allows all internet-connected devices to communicate.

II. TCP: Reliable Data Delivery

    - Role: Ensures data arrives completely and in order (like a certified mail service).

    - How it works:
       + Breaks data into small packets.
       + Verifies integrity with authentication checks.

    - Key Protocols Using TCP: HTTP/HTTPS (websites), POP3 (email), SSH (secure remote access), SMTP (email sending), FTP (file transfers).

    - Connection Process (3-Way Handshake):

        Step	Action	                    Description
        1	    Client → Server: SYN	    "Can we talk?"
        2	    Server → Client: SYN-ACK	"Yes! Here’s my confirmation."
        3	    Client → Server: ACK	    "Got it – let’s start!" → Connection open!

    - TCP States (Like a Conversation Lifecycle):

        - LISTEN: Server is waiting for a connection request.
        - SYN-SENT: Client has sent a connection request and is waiting for a response.
        - SYN-RECEIVED: Server has received the request and responded with SYN-ACK; waiting for final ACK.
        - ESTABLISHED: Connection is fully open; data can be transferred.
        - FIN-WAIT-1: One side has sent a request to terminate the connection.
        - FIN-WAIT-2: Waiting for the other side to send its termination request.
        - CLOSE-WAIT: Waiting for the application to close after receiving a termination request.
        - CLOSING: Both sides have sent termination requests; waiting for final ACK.
        - LAST-ACK: Waiting for ACK of the final termination request.
        - TIME-WAIT: Waiting to ensure the remote side received the final ACK.
        - CLOSED: Connection is fully terminated.

III. IP: The Internet’s GPS

    - Role: Routes packets between computers using IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.10).
    - How it works:
        1. Adds IP headers to packets (source/destination addresses).
        2. Does NOT check for errors – that’s TCP’s job!
    "IP only cares about the address, not what’s inside the package."

    - Critical Note: If a packet is sent to a closed port, the server replies with RST (reset) to refuse the connection.

IV. TCP/IP Model: 4 Layers

    Layer	                Nickname	            Function	                                Protocols/Devices
    4. Application	        "The App"	            User-facing apps & protocols	            HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH
    3. Transport	        "The Post Office"	    Reliable data delivery	                    TCP (reliable), UDP (fast)
    2. Network	            "The Router"	        Addressing & routing between networks	    IP, Routers
    1. Network Interface	"The Cable"	            Physical connections & bit transmission	    Ethernet, Wi-Fi, NICs (Network Interface Cards)

V. TCP Connection Deep Dive
    
    - Full Workflow 
    
    User sends file via FTP:

        1. Application Layer: FTP client initiates transfer.

        2. Transport Layer: TCP splits file → SYN sent to server.

        3. Network Layer: IP adds addresses → routes packets.

        4. Network Interface: Converts data to bits → sends via cable/Wi-Fi.

    Server responds:

        Open port? → SYN-ACK → ACK → data flows.
        Closed port? → RST (connection refused).
